## Pygame Flappy Bird
A simple Python implementation of Flappy Bird.

This project was made in order to be used for the implementation of a NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm that was to create smart agents which could successfully play the game forever without making a mistake. This repository only contains the plain Flappy Bird game implementation.
